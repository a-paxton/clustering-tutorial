# A tutorial on k-means clustering *(with more R lessons along the way)*

This repository presents a tutorial to implement K-means clustering in R.
It is intended to complement the first half of UConn's
Social-Ecological-Environmental (SEE) Lab's introduction to machine learning
and K-means clustering, led by
[Shu Jiang](https://socialpsych.uconn.edu/person/shu-jiang/) (graduate student,
Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Connecticut).

I'll also be using this as an opportunity to share a few R programming tips
along the way. It may be especially helpful for those who are not familiar
with programming with the Tidyverse, a useful cluster of libraries in R.

With many, many thanks to Bradley Boehmke for the
[K-means Cluster Analysis tutorial](https://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering)
on the University of Cincinnati's Business Analytics R Programming Guide,
on which this tutorial is modeled.

## Requirements

For this tutorial, you will need:
- R
- `tidyverse` library
- `ggplot2` library
- `viridis` library
- `cluster` library
- `factoextra` library

## Optional add-ons

If you haven't already, I would strongly recommend installing
[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), a useful IDE (integrated development
environment) for R. It has lots of helpful capabilities that can make your
programming experience a bit smoother.

If you're looking for more datasets to start exploring k-means clustering in
more depth, check out the datasets available from the
[Open-Source Psychometrics Project](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/).
